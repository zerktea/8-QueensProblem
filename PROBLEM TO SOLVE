Write a program that uses the genetic  algorithm to solve 8  queens  problem.
Implement:
•8-digit, integer-value genome,•the fitness function of the form:
f(configuration) =28−number_of_attacks(configuration),
•the genetic operators
♦roulette wheel selection,
♦two-site crossover,
♦mutationas explained on the lecture.
Experiment with the size of population and the probability of mutation(roughlyspeaking that probability should be low).
